What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that learn from data and improve automatically over time without being explicitly programmed.
In Simple Terms:
Machine learning teaches computers to recognize patterns, make decisions, and improve from experience — much like humans learn from examples.

Example:
Imagine teaching a computer to recognize cats in photos:

- Provide thousands of images labeled "cat" or "not cat".
- The machine analyzes patterns like ears, whiskers, and shape.
- Later, it can predict whether a new photo contains a cat — even if it has never seen that exact photo before.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - The model is trained on labeled data (input + correct output).
   - Example: Spam detection in emails.

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - The model learns from unlabeled data by identifying hidden patterns.
   - Example: Grouping customers by purchasing behavior.

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties.
   - Example: Training a game-playing AI or a self-driving car.

Real-World Applications:

-  Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube, Amazon)
-  Self-driving vehicles
-  Medical diagnosis tools
-  Face recognition software
-  Chatbots and virtual assistants (like this one!)

Machine Learning is at the core of modern AI and continues to evolve rapidly, powering smarter applications and systems across every industry.
